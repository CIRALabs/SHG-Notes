Regrets: Jacques

0) core of smarkaklink.
  a) all but last step of smarkaklink enabled.
  b) may be able to do it all by Tuesday, shg_highway is returning voucher bound to wrong voucher.

1) can Elson reproduce this on Wednesday?
   everyone try to do provisioning independantly.
   which comet server will we use?  

2) what next after smarkaklink.
  a) mobile APP
  b) SPIN integration
  c) DNS-publication.
  d) we can move to beta1 of Turris OS4 (Audric to send link to medkit by end of day -> build new medkit once smarkaklink is completed)
  
  
3) SPIN integration
  a) how to include it into medkit
  b) how to manage access to SPIN API through mud-supervisor Role Based Access Control
  c) how to replace our firewall with SPIN their code.
  -- can we ask some useful questions for SIDN people on Friday?
  -> Audric will start working on a) & b) (at least). Try to at least have it compiling in background to see if there are any issues that can be raised on Friday call
  

3) Round table of people.
  a) Lucas:
  b) Julien: 
  c) Elson:  still setting up SHG physical box.
  d) Audric: smarkaklink, medkit to beta-01, WPA-PSK from mud-supervisor's DB
  e) Daniel:
  f) Gillian:
  g) Michael:  worked on Front-end naming document with Daniel Migault, attended iot613, and worked on shg_mud_supervisor/smarkaklink.
  h) Marc:
  

4) WPA-Key into database, and into hostapd. (AS)
  - tried integration with hostapd... it is working!
  - some path/SQL configuration. register.conf from hostapd custom package (https://github.com/CIRALabs/SHG-feeds/blob/wpa-psk-from-mud-supervisor/network/utils/shg-radius-configuration/files/radiusd.conf).
  - Wifi is broken, mud-supervisor integration still needed, windex API still needed.
  -> (Audric) Will put together a "hacked" mud-supervisor configuration (eg. static IP address on bridge) and create medkit so people can try generate WIFI password using Windex client

5) what are the next steps for Mobile APP? 
6) 

15:40 closed.
