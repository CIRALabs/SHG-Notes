Discussion from Joe about how to do time-based restriction of firmware
updates.

    DOCSIS - has firmware update and can go to 10G, so bandwidth restrictions
    really matter.
    What is the enforcement mechanism for exceeding the bandwidth: do we drop
    packets, or do we police/shape them?

    Eliot: bandwidth is applied to an ACL.
    Tiru: right now, bandwidth raises an Alert, but uncertain how to enforce
          against it.

Curation of MUD files:
    -

Brian: take devices, hide who manufacturer is, and then do long-term profile
of device traffic, ... compare against what manufacturer says.   SIDN SPIN.

Doug: NIST has jurisdiction over other entities to enforce MUD files.
    MUD might want to host and curate them, but might want to also create
    derivative profiles.

MUD search lists across organizational boundaries.
Discussion about crowd sourcing.

A MUD repo on github will be created by Eliot.

PADMA (Futurewei)

Discussion about amending MUD files in real time, or on per-device basis.
