SPIN
----

1. running on Turris.

2. did not have to add package feed... from nic.cz, not 18.06.
   took some convincing to run. default was 192.168.8.1.
   in confluence ... script to change network that it was looking at.
   
3. depends mqtt/mosquito.  Does not configure mosquito correctly.
   uses mqtt to collect data... web sockets.  
   Uses to bubble things from kernel module to webUI.
   No persistence layer.

4. how does SPIN identify compromised systems.
   kernel module does firewall processing.... unsure.

5. what are the rule sets about?  What can we configure?

6. can we filter just for one device behind router?

7. everything is real time, so how to get history of what the device has been
   doing?

8. new device event is sent out.

9.
